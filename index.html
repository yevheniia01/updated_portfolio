                <p>My name is Yevheniia, I was born in Ukraine. In big city Kiev. I came to United States in 2016, right now I live in Cary North Carolina. I love this place and probably will stay here forever. I have a little daughter and loving husband. I dont have much codding background, but I was studying HTML, CSS, JAVA Script and SQL at CodeAcademy website. It was great source for me. As I said originally from Ukraine, I was working as daycare teacher, also attended to University where was studying program engineering for two years, I have had to quit my University since were prepearing to move to United States. Also I really love animals, my favorites are reptiles. I have amazing bearded dragon, and used to have Veiled Chameleons. I can spend a lot of time with them.</p>
